Project Overview:

The Bodyshape Landing Page is a responsive, visually striking fitness website built using HTML and Tailwind CSS. Designed to promote fitness programs, trainers, and membership plans, the site follows a dark, modern aesthetic with bold orange highlights to capture user attention. It includes key sections such as a hero banner, program features, pricing plans, trainer showcase, benefits, and a structured footer.

Project Technologies:

1.HTML
2.Tailwind CSS
3.Font Awesome
4.GitHub

Problem:
While implementing the banner section using Tailwind CSS, I successfully added a background image that worked perfectly in the local development environment. However, after deploying to a live server ( GitHub Pages), the background image was not loading.

To resolve this issue, I used an external CSS file where I defined the background image using regular CSS.
